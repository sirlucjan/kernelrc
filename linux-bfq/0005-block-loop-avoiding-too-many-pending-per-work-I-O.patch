Subject: [PATCH 2/2] block: loop: avoiding too many pending per work I/O

If there are too many pending per work I/O, too many
high priority work thread can be generated so that
system performance can be effected.

This patch limits the max_active parameter of workqueue as 16.

This patch fixes Fedora 22 live booting performance
regression when it is booted from squashfs over dm
based on loop, and looks the following reasons are
related with the problem:

- not like other filesyststems(such as ext4), squashfs
is a bit special, and I observed that increasing I/O jobs
to access file in squashfs only improve I/O performance a
little, but it can make big difference for ext4

- nested loop: both squashfs.img and ext3fs.img are mounted
as loop block, and ext3fs.img is inside the squashfs

- during booting, lots of tasks may run concurrently
